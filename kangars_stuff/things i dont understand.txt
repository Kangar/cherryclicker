Things i don't understand:
Why class HelloWorld inherits from object, and WTF is "object" in python (a class?).
WTF is a decorator.
WTF is __main__, __init__, the self parameter, and when to use them.
__name__ - contains the name of the module that runs that code. 
So, "if __name__ == '__main__'" checks whether the code inside the module
In my case- my python file is actually a module if imported by 
another python file.
